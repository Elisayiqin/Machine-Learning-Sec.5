First, read the description, and then download the “crx.data”, a CSV file.

# Tasks 
*	Build a prediction system based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that can predict a person’s credit-worthiness (+ or -).
  * Please try various architectures of the ANNs and report test evaluation results (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1).
* Each of the architectures should vary the following:
  *	Number of layers
  *	Number of neurons (i.e., perceptrons) per layer
  *	Activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, RELU, etc.)
*	Using Kera’s model.summary() function, print each of the architecture.
*	Try different hyper-parameters for each of the above architectures:
  *	Number of epochs: 100+
  *	Learning rate: 0.01+
*	Please list potential ethical bias inherent to solving the problem. And discuss how are you going to address the issue.
